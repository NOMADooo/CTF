The page constellations.page/meet-the-team.txt was saying that because of security reasons the list of employees were removed but it was available before at some point. Firstly I checked with WayBackMachine if the page was cached before so I could access that page from before the "security reasons" but I didn't worked. The hint was that Vala shouldn't write about version control system, so i checked if constellations.page/.git is accessible but it wasn't.(It existed but I didn't had permissions to view it), I used the GitTools(https://github.com/internetwache/GitTools) to dump that folder, extracted all the commits and checked meet-the-team.html from before. The second commit had all the data about the employees (That will be later used to track down the rest of the flags) and of course the flag itself.
